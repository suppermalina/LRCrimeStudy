#A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you
#need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, 
#operate on each piece and then put all the pieces back together. 
#For example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or time point in your study, 
#summarise data by panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. 
#The development of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton Dickinson'.
